## üìã Abstract

<p>This study aims to predict the closing price of Yes Bank stock using regression analysis. The study uses a dataset containing historical stock prices of Yes Bank from Jully 2005 to November 2020. The dataset includes variables such as opening price, highest price, lowest price, and closing price and date. The study applies multiple linear regression and other regression techniques to build models that predict the closing price of Yes Bank stock. The models are evaluated using root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) metrics. We have also taken cross validation score into account to finalize the model. The results indicate that both random regressor and XGBoost perform well in predicting the closing price of Yes Bank stock, with random regressor performed well in accuracy parameter. The study concludes that regression analysis can be a useful tool for predicting stock prices and can be valuable for investors in making informed decisions</p>

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap and Navigation guide

<hr>

### Step 1: Data Collection
Collect the historical stock prices of Yes Bank from January 2005 to September 2020. Include variables such as opening price, highest price, lowest price, and closing price and date

<hr>

### Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Clean the dataset by removing any missing values, outliers, or errors. Preprocess the dataset by scaling or normalizing the features as necessary.

<hr>

### Step 3: Regression Model Building
Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. Implement Multiple Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models to predict the closing price of Yes Bank stock. Tune the models by adjusting the hyperparameters to optimize performance.

<hr>

### Step 4: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the models' performance using root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) metrics. Compare the performance of the models to determine which one performs better.

<hr>

### Step 5: Results and Conclusion
Present the results of the regression analysis. Discuss the implications of the results and their potential impact on investors. Provide conclusions and suggestions for future research.

## :scroll: Conclusion

Stock Price prediction with the help of Machine Learning models is less time consuming and also it gives good performance.

Stock price was continuously increasing till 2018 after that it decreases due to fraud case of Rana Kapoor.

All independent variables (Open,High& Low) are extremely correlated with dependent variable(Close).

All independent variables are highly correlated with each other(Multicollinearity)

Distribution of all independent and dependent variables was right skewed and after log transformation it became Normal.

I have compared 5 models(Linear Regression,Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, and XGBoost Regression) on the basis of RMSE and MAPE.

RMSE and MAPE are mostly used as evaluatuion metrics to measure forecast accuracy.

XGBoost Regression is best model among all five models with lowest RMSE=0.0512, and MAPE=0.0175 than other models and also it has highest r2 score(r2 score=0.9859) than other models.
